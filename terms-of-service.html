            <h1><strong>Jetti Terms of Service Agreement</strong></h1>
            <p>For the term of the Jetti Free Tryout and Service Agreement (“Service Agreement”), including any renewals, Jetti Systems will provide Merchant with the Jetti service subject to the Jetti Terms of Service Agreement (“Terms of Service”).</p>

            <p>Jetti Systems may amend the Terms of Service from time to time, with amendments taking effect 2 days after being posted on http://www.jettisystems.com/tearms-of-service.html. Please check the website regularly for updates. </p>

            <h2>License</h2>
            <p>Merchant will be granted a limited, personal, nonexclusive, nontransferable, and non-assignable license to use Jetti Systems’ supplied technologies for the term of the Service Agreement. This includes all supplied software and hardware components, including all subsequent modifications, iterations and add-ons made thereto. Jetti Systems may, in its sole discretion and without notice, redesign and/or modify all or any portion of the Jetti service.</p>

            <p>Merchant is solely responsible for protecting access to its online Jetti Administration Panel and for any authorized or unauthorized use of its password(s). Merchant shall refrain from permitting any third party to use its password(s) or otherwise access the Administration Panel. Jetti Systems shall have the right to terminate the license granted hereby immediately in the event that Merchant has breached the Service Agreement or Terms of Service or Merchant’s account is otherwise terminated for any reason.<br><a href="tearms-of-service.html"><small>Back to Top</small></a></p>

            <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
            <p>Jetti Systems is the sole and exclusive owner of all rights, title, and interests in Jetti, including all aspects of its software and hardware components. Merchant may not copy, modify, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, tamper with, or repurpose any component of Jetti. </p>

            <p>Jetti Systems is the sole and exclusive owner of all rights, title and interest in and to any data provided to Jetti Systems by Merchant’s customers or any end user of the Jetti service, including all e-mail and/or other customer provided information (“Customer Data”). Merchant shall not, unless the applicable customer has separately taken all steps necessary to opt in to provide information to Merchant, be provided with or otherwise have access to any Customer Data except that which is provided to Merchant through the Jetti Administration Panel.<br><a href="tearms-of-service.html"><small>Back to Top</small></a></p>

            <h2>Proper Uses</h2>
            <p>Merchant may only use Jetti and its individual components in its designated place of business as a customer engagement program as contemplated by the Service Agreement and Terms of Service.</p>

            <p>Proper uses include using the Jetti Administration Panel as it is intended and within the limitations of the Jetti service as they have been designed or may exist, placing Tag Stations in visible locations, such as on tables or on the bar to ease customer interaction, authorizing legitimate customer point-earning and item redemptions occurring through the Jetti service, and immediately reporting to Jetti Systems any actual or suspected unauthorized or fraudulent use of the Jetti service.</p>

            <p>Jetti Systems, in its sole discretion, may reject, remove, amend, modify, delete or cancel any information or content entered into, created or generated through the Jetti service without exception. This includes, but is not limited to suspending or removing Merchant and/or customer accounts, amending points resulting from mistakes or fraudulent or suspected fraudulent activity, and removing any material Jetti Systems finds distasteful.<br><a href="tearms-of-service.html"><small>Back to Top</small></a></p>

            <h2>Restrictions</h2>
            <p>Merchant may not sell, rent, lease, license or sublicense, assign, distribute, transfer, or use Jetti in any way not permitted or contemplated by the Service Agreement or Terms of Service.<br><a href="tearms-of-service.html"><small>Back to Top</small></a></p>

            <h2>Proper Maintenance</h2>
            <p>Jetti Tag Stations are the property of Jetti Systems on license to Merchant and are to be maintained with a reasonable duty of care. Tag Stations may be periodically cleaned or cleaned when necessary with a damp cloth. Merchant is to immediately remove from service any Tag Station that it suspects may have been tampered with, is malfunctioning, is damaged or in disrepair, or is otherwise not functioning.<br><a href="tearms-of-service.html"><small>Back to Top</small></a></p>

            <h2>Replacement</h2>
            <p>Merchant is to immediately notify Jetti Systems of any Tag Station that has been removed from service, lost, stolen, or otherwise not able to be used. Such Tag Stations will be replaced at the Merchant’s expense at a cost to be determined at the time of occurrence. Tag Stations that need replaced are to be shipped to address in the Returns section below.<br><a href="tearms-of-service.html"><small>Back to Top</small></a></p>

            <h2>Renewals</h2>
            <p>Merchant’s Service Agreement will automatically renew for a new term equal to the current term at the then-current rate based on Merchant’s current seating capacity unless Merchant provides written notice of nonrenewal 30 days prior to the end of the current term.<br><a href="tearms-of-service.html"><small>Back to Top</small></a></p>

            <h2>Taxes</h2>
            <p>Merchant is responsible for any sales, use, value-added or import taxes, customs duties or similar taxes assessed in accordance with applicable law with respect to the provision and ongoing use of the Jetti service.<br><a href="tearms-of-service.html"><small>Back to Top</small></a></p>

            <h2>Cancellation</h2>
            <p>Except as may be provided in the Free Tryout Period of the Service Agreement, Merchants may cancel their Jetti service at any time by providing 30 days written notice to <a href="mailto:sales@jettisystems.com">sales@jettisystems.com</a> explaining its reasons for cancellation. If cancelled before the end of the Service Agreement, a cancellation fee of $1,000.00 will apply.</p>

            <p>Within 10 days of a notice of Cancellation, Merchant is to return any Jetti Tag Stations in its possession to Jetti Systems at the address in the Returns section below.<br><a href="tearms-of-service.html"><small>Back to Top</small></a></p>

            <h2>Termination</h2>
            <p>Jetti Systems, in its discretion, may terminate the Service Agreement or suspend the Jetti service at any time. Other potential reasons for termination or suspension include:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Merchant provides timely notice of nonrenewal</li>
              <li>Merchant provides notice of Cancellation </li>
              <li>Merchant fails to make a payment by a due date</li>

              <li>Institution of insolvency, receivership, or bankruptcy proceedings of either party</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Within 10 days of a notice of Termination, Merchant is to return any Jetti Tag Stations in its possession to Jetti Systems at the address in the Returns section below. Merchant is responsible for all return shipping charges and for any damage incurred in the shipping process. If any Jetti hardware item is not returned, Jetti Systems will charge Merchant for the cost of the item not returned. The cost per Tag Station is $5.00.</p>

            <p>In the event of any termination, Jetti Systems will be entitled to send e-mail and/or other communications to some or all of Merchant’s loyalty program members, notifying each such member of Merchant’s termination. Additionally, Jetti Systems will be entitled to take other actions, at its discretion, to assist Merchant’s loyalty program members in protecting the points earned within the Jetti service by any means Jetti Systems deems appropriate. <br><a href="tearms-of-service.html"><small>Back to Top</small></a></p>
