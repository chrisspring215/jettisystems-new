                <p>Universal rewards platforms are now the fastest growing model of loyalty programs. By our count, there are more than 20 such programs now in existence, each offering similar but slightly different formats and features. However, such programs have many shortcomings that may cause them to fail in your particular restaurant. If you are considering a universal loyalty program for your organization, you should highly consider the pros and cons of this loyalty model.</p>

                <h3>Universal Rewards Platforms</h3>
                <p>The basic concept of a universal program is simple- it offers a universally branded solution that can create a network effect among many different businesses. Such programs are typically branded to the rewards company providing the service and not to the particular businesses employing it. This allows, for example, a participating customer to sign up for the program at a local coffee shop, and then also use it at the local bakery that is also participating.</p>

                <p>Depending on the particular program’s quality and format, universal programs can be advantageous for small retailers that offer counter-service. An independent store can join an already robust network of participating merchants and benefit by the network of existing members who use the program. <strong>The obvious downside to this is that merchants often discover they are sharing the platform, and thus access to their customers, with their competitors</strong>.</p>

                <h3>A Lack of Adoption in FSR</h3>
                <p>While universal platforms are growing in popularity with independents to help them compete with larger competitors, <strong>the vast majority of large organizations have been completely unwilling to adopt such programs</strong>. In fact, not one of the over 150 full-service restaurant organizations we reviewed was utilizing a universal program.</p>

                <p>The reasons universal programs are not appealing to large restaurant organizations are fairly obvious. For starters, most large organizations do not want to share access to customers with hundreds or even thousands of competitors in every market where they compete. Even many independent restauranteurs we surveyed find this situation unappealing. <strong>The benefits of a “network effect” take a nosedive when your organization is building the network for other businesses, including your competitors</strong>.  </p>

                <p>Secondly, most restaurant organizations want to control their own branding. By adopting a universal platform, you are effectively <strong>substituting your relationship with your customers for that of the platform itself</strong>, which must maintain its brand consistency across many different businesses and industries. If best-in-class performers like Starbucks and Panera can teach us anything, it is that <strong>retaining your brand identity is the key to building lasting customer loyalty and brand advocacy</strong>.</p>

                <h3>A Better Fit for QSR</h3>
                <p>Most importantly, <strong>none of the universal platforms we found are designed to succeed in a full-service restaurant environment</strong>. Because universal programs must be universally deployable, they are built as a one-size-fits-all solution. Unfortunately, that solution only fits if your business revolves predominantly around counter-service. This is not a dig at universal programs; they are seeking to accommodate as many types of businesses as possible. However, such formats are not effective at onboarding and interacting with customers in full-service restaurants, which are unique, in that customers are seated at a table.</p>

                <p>If you are serious about building long-term customer loyalty, shielding your customer network (a valuable business asset) from your competitors, and succeeding in a full-service restaurant environment, you may want to think twice about adopting a universal program.</p>
